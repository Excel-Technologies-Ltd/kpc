"""Shared helpers for the Petroleum Operations module.

This module centralises logic that must behave identically across every
transaction doctype in the 13-step KPC workflow:

- Golden Thread (``journey_ref``) propagation and audit logging.
- Oil Tank operational-state guarding (Maintenance / Quarantine).
- Volumetric conversion (temperature/density correction to 15C).

Keeping this logic in one place is what lets us claim "100% auditability":
every doctype that touches the Golden Thread calls :func:`log_journey_step`
instead of re-implementing its own bookkeeping.
